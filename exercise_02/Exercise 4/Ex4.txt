- scaling of y-axis is inconsistent
    - starts on steps of 30, than 50, 10 once, than 50 continuously
- no mention of the disease whose cases are being counted of
    - (can be ommitted, since its obviously about the covid-19 pandemic)

- color of some circles are too similar
    - e.g. "Texas" and "Utah" are difficult to separate (on our screens)
    - which blue circle is directly behind Pennsylvania? ...we can't see

- bar chart does not start at zero
    - red sox seem to have only a fifth of the win percentage of the yankees

- inverted y-axis is confusing
    - on the first loo, gun deaths appear to decline
- coloring is manipulative, visualization connotates the gun deaths as a "bleeding wound"
    - subjectively we think thats acceptable, objectively we have to mention it
