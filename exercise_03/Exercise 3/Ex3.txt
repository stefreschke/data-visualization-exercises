- point visualized does not require map of the USA
- southern USA is implied to be solely "white"
- @2010, complete rectangle is assumed,
    thus the "asian" (purple) strip is not visible, despite being there
- it is misleading: percentage is visualized using the height at the given year,
    the viewer first thinks the percentages are represented using the colored area
    (why else would you put Alaska there?)

- totally confusing at the beginning (where is the time?)
- no comparability for different countries on same days
- too many countries, with 8 lines this is already too confusing
- what does the increasing thickness of the lines mean?
- "France" and "UK" overlap themselves (see April 9th), it is difficult to follow them with eyes only

- unclear: which country/region is referred to? (only accessible through context of vis1.jpg)
- 2010/2060: forgot to order pie slice by size
(- nose and chin distort the pie charts idea of using only the area (angles) to convey information
- eye = "Other"?) - we do not perceive these to be severe

- indifferent: color coding is categorical when diverging (or two combined sequential) scale(s)
    would have been better, e.g. +1$ and +1000$ are both bright green, while -1$ and -1000$ are both dark referred
    similarity between +1$ and -1$ is not shown
- why are there visible lines?
- y axis cut (title limits to middle class though),
    is the categorization middleclass -> +40.000$ reasoned?
