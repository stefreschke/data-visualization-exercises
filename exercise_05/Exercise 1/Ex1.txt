- Two visualization which are directly next to each other. The user needs time to realize that both visualizations are based on the map of Arizona.
  In our case it took us 10 seconds to realize it.
  Solution:
    1. Merge visualizations into a single visualization with interaction techniques
    2. Clear separation of both visualizations (e.g. by providing 2 instead of 1 diagram)
    3. Make the area of Arizona in the left visualization clearer (e.g. by providing a white-line with its border)

- Missing legend: It is unclear what the specific color hues mean.
  Solution: Add legend.

- No geographic reference is given: If we were living in a town in Arizona, we could not easily access the rain gauge next to our village,
  it is assumed that every user of the visualization knows how to apply it
  Solution:
   - add geological reference (e.g. the capital of Arizona and bigger cities in it)
