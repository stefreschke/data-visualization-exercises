Pros:
 - shadow of "the green sausages" enables positioning it on the 2D map on the floor (grey)
 - isobars visualized on the 2D map on the floor to disconfuse 3D visualization over it
 - axis are repeated multily to give a proper reference and show that on different points,
   the height of the "green sausages" upper bound remains the same

Cons:
 - no axis uses a unit nor a title/subtitle, leaving their meaning unclear
 - isobars (we think they are isobars) have no axis or any related information besides their location
   Is it a high-pressure area or low-pressure area?
   The section of isobars behind the smaller "green sausage" on the left looks like a mountain, implying that the
   isobars are displayed in 3D as well. But this so unclear, that it can be mistaken as an optical illusion
 - it is unclear what the meaning of the vertical plots is?
 - the vertical plot in the middle (spanning from iceland to the west of norway) is hidden
   by the plot right before it as well as the "green sausage" passing it
 - the sausages should be brown (to complete the sceomorphism)
